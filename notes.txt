1. we cannot have any other columns selected along with aggregate functions
for example: select city, max(length(city)) from station;

2. modulus operator in sql
mod(id,2)

3. The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
