1. we cannot have any other columns selected along with aggregate functions
for example: select city, max(length(city)) from station;

2. modulus operator in sql
mod(id,2) - select even number of ids

3. The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions
syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

4. to select the top row in sql oracle use rownum=1

5. sorting multiple coulumns in opposite way
Example: select city, length(city) 
        from (select city from station order by length(city) desc, city asc) 
        where rownum=1;

6. string operation: upper(), lower(), substr(), substr() from backwards
select distinct(city) from station where upper(substr(city,1,1)) in ('A','E','I','O','U'); staring with vowel
select distinct(city) from station where upper(substr(city,-1,1)) in ('A','E','I','O','U'); ending with vowel

7. switch case in sql
select
case
when (A+B)<= C then 'Not A Triangle'
when A=B and B=C then 'Equilateral'
when A=B or B=C or C=A then 'Isosceles'
else 'Scalene'
end
from triangles;

8. || String Concatenation Operator - Oracle 
select name || '(' || substr(occupation, 1, 1) || ')' 
from occupations
order by name;

select 'There are a total of ' || count(occupation) || ' ' || lower(occupation) || 's.'
from occupations
group by occupation
order by count(occupation), occupation;
